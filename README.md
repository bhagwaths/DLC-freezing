# DLC-freezing

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to measure freezing or struggling behavior based on pose coordinates from [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut).

- **CheckThresholds**

  This script allows the user to enter video and coordinate information and set thresholds in a GUI. Users can interactively view the video frame-by-frame with behavior labels and plot coordinate distance change by frame to determine optimal thresholds.
